# pong-py

Pong game written in Python language using Turtle as the GUI library.

The game can be played by two players.

Player 1 controls: 'W' for up and 'S' for down.
Player 2 controls: 'Up Arrow' for up and 'Down Arrow" for down.

The game has some issues when playing on either fast or slow computers. It currently works fine on my laptop.
